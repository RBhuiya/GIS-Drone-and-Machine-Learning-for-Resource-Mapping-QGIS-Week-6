# 🌍 Project Overview
In Week 6, we advanced our spatial analysis skills by integrating Google Earth Pro with high-resolution LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data to uncover historical insights related to urbanization in and around our campus – MCKV Institute of Engineering, Liluah, Howrah, West Bengal.

LiDAR provides detailed elevation and surface models, allowing us to assess changes in land use, construction density, and infrastructure over time. By combining satellite imagery with LiDAR, we were able to observe how urban growth has reshaped the region.
