# 🌏📗 GIS-Drone-and-Machine-Learning-for-Resource-Mapping-QGIS-Week-6 🗾
# # 🇮🇳 QGIS India's Geospatial Data Project

# 🌍 Project Overview
In Week 6, we advanced our spatial analysis skills by integrating Google Earth Pro with high-resolution LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data to uncover historical insights related to urbanization in and around our campus – MCKV Institute of Engineering, Liluah, Howrah, West Bengal.

LiDAR provides detailed elevation and surface models, allowing us to assess changes in land use, construction density, and infrastructure over time. By combining satellite imagery with LiDAR, we were able to observe how urban growth has reshaped the region.

# 🎯 Objective
- To use Google Earth Pro for visualizing historic satellite imagery and urban changes.
- To introduce LiDAR data into our analysis for precise elevation and structural mapping.
- To evaluate how urbanization has affected the local geography of the MCKV campus area.
- To identify the benefits and drawbacks of rapid development in an urban setting.

# ✨ Key Features
- Use of Google Earth Pro’s timeline to visualize past and present imagery.
- Integration of LiDAR datasets for high-resolution terrain and structural analysis.
- Urbanization study of the MCKV Institute of Engineering surroundings.
- Identification of infrastructure growth, environmental decline, and socio-economic change.
- Insightful conclusions using geo-intelligence techniques.

🛠️ Project Steps
1. Opened Google Earth Pro and navigated to the MCKV campus area.
2. Used the historical imagery tool to analyze changes from past decades.
3. Integrated LiDAR datasets (Digital Surface Models and Digital Terrain Models) into GIS tools to observe:
  - Building height variations
  - Urban sprawl
  - Road expansion and infrastructure growth
4. Compared historical vs current views to evaluate urban impact.
5. Noted key pros and cons of urbanization based on geospatial evidence.

# 📊 LiDAR-Based Urbanization Insights
**✅ Pros:**
  - 📈 Improved Local Economy – Growth in businesses and real estate.
  - 🏗️ Rapid Infrastructure Development – Increased construction of roads, housing, and public utilities.
  - 🚉 Enhanced Transport Connectivity – Better road networks and access to transit hubs.

**⚠️ Cons:**
  - 🚧 Over-Concretization – Loss of green cover and open spaces.
  - 🧯 Compromised Safety Standards – In high-risk zones, disaster resilience is low.
  - 🌫️ Environmental Degradation – Decline in air quality, groundwater levels, and increased urban heat islands.
